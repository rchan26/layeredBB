\title{Bessel Bridge path sampler given minimum}
\usage{
min_Bessel_bridge_path_sampler(x, y, s, t, m, tau, times, checks = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{start value of Bessel bridge}

\item{y}{end value of Bessel bridge}

\item{s}{start time of Bessel bridge}

\item{t}{end time of Bessel bridge}

\item{m}{minimum point}

\item{tau}{time of minimum point}

\item{times}{vector of real numbers to simulate Bessel bridge}

\item{checks}{logical value to determine if arguments that are passed into 
the function are checked. Things that are checked include that 
s < t, that requested simulation times are in [s,t], that m <= min(x,y)
and that if tau == s or tau == t, then m == x or m == y, respectively}

\value{
A list with the following components
\describe{
  \item{full_path}{Matrix of the simulated Bessel bridge path at all 
                   included time points, i.e. s, t and times. The times
                   are sorted and duplicates are removed. The first row
                   are the points of the Brownian bridge (named 'X') 
                   second row are corresponding times (named 'time')}
  \item{simulated_path}{Matrix of the simulated Bessel bridge path only at 
                        the specified times passed into the function, i.e. 
                        the times vector. The times are not sorted and
                        duplicates are not removed. The first row
                        are the points of the Bessel bridge (named 'X') 
                        second row are corresponding times (named 'time')}
  \item{remove_m_path}{Matrix of the simulated Bessel bridge path only at 
                       all included times points excluding tau. These times
                       are sorted and duplicates are removed. The first row
                       are the points of the Bessel bridge (named 'X') 
                       second row are corresponding times (named 'time'). 
                       Note that the minimum point is included if it is 
                       passed into the times vector}
