\title{Multi-dimensional Layered Brownian Bridge sampler}
\usage{
multi_layered_brownian_bridge(dim, x, y, s, t, bessel_layers, times)
}
\arguments{
\item{dim}{dimension of Brownian bridge}

\item{x}{start value of Brownian bridge}

\item{y}{end value of Brownian bridge}

\item{s}{start time of Brownian bridge}

\item{t}{end time of Brownian bridge}

\item{bessel_layers}{a list of length dim where list[i] is the Bessel layer for component i}

\item{times}{vector of real numbers to simulate Bessel bridge}
}
\value{
A list with the following components
\describe{
  \item{full_path}{Matrix of the simulated layered Brownian bridge path at all 
                   included time points, i.e. s, t and times. The times
                   are sorted and duplicates are removed. The first dim rows
                   are the points of the Brownian bridge in each component,
                   last row gives the corresponding times}
  \item{simulated_path}{Matrix of the simulated layered Brownian bridge path 
                        only at the specified times passed into the function, 
                        i.e. the times vector. The times are not sorted and
                        duplicates are not removed. The first dim rows
                        are the points of the layered Brownian bridge in 
                        each component, last row gives the corresponding times}
