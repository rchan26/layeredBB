\title{Brownian Bridge maximum point sampler}
\usage{
max_sampler(x, y, s, t, low_bound, up_bound, checks = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{start value of Brownian bridge}

\item{y}{end value of Brownian bridge}

\item{s}{start time of Brownian bridge}

\item{t}{end time of Brownian bridge}

\item{low_bound}{Lower bound of maximum point (max(x,y) <= low_bound < up_bound)}

\item{up_bound}{Upper bound of maximum point (max(x,y) <= low_bound < up_bound)}

\item{checks}{logical value to determine if arguments that are passed into 
the function are checked. Things that are checked include that 
max(x,y) <= low_bound < up_bound and that s < t}
}
\value{
vector: the simulated maximum, 'max', and time where maximum occurs, 'tau'
}
\description{
Simulation of a maximum point of a Brownian bridge
}
\examples{
# simulate a maximum between 0 and 1 of a Brownian bridge starting at 
# 0 and ending at 0 in time [0,1]
max_sampler(x = 0, y = 0, s = 0, t = 1, low_bound = 0, up_bound = 1)

# plotting multiple simulated maximums and their times
maximums <- sapply(1:5000, function(i) {
  max_sampler(x = 0, y = 0, s = 0, t = 1, low_bound = 0 , up_bound = 10)
})
plot(x = maximums[2,], y = maximums[1,], pch = 20, lwd = 0.1,
     xlab = 'Time', ylab = 'X')
