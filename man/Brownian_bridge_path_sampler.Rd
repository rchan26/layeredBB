\title{Brownian Bridge path sampler (Algorithm 13 in ST329)}
\usage{
Brownian_bridge_path_sampler(x, y, s, t, times)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{start value of Brownian bridge}

\item{y}{end value of Brownian bridge}

\item{s}{start time of Brownian bridge}

\item{t}{end time of Brownian bridge}

\item{times}{vector of real numbers to simulate Brownian bridge}
}
\value{
A list with the following components
\describe{
  \item{full_path}{Matrix of the simulated Brownian bridge path at all 
                   included time points, i.e. s, t and times. The times
                   are sorted and duplicates are removed. The first row
                   are the points of the Brownian bridge (named 'X') 
                   second row are corresponding times (named 'time')}
  \item{simulated_path}{Matrix of the simulated Brownian bridge path only at 
                        the specified times passed into the function, i.e. 
                        the times vector. The times are not sorted and
                        duplicates are not removed. The first row
                        are the points of the Brownian bridge (named 'X') 
                        second row are corresponding times (named 'time')}
