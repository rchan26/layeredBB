\title{Brownian Bridge minimum point sampler (Algorithm 14 in ST329)}
\usage{
min_sampler(x, y, s, t, low_bound, up_bound, checks = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{start value of Brownian bridge}

\item{y}{end value of Brownian bridge}

\item{s}{start time of Brownian bridge}

\item{t}{end time of Brownian bridge}

\item{low_bound}{Lower bound of minimum point (low_bound < up_bound <= min(x,y))}

\item{up_bound}{Upper bound of minimum point (low_bound < up_bound <= min(x,y))}

\item{checks}{logical value to determine if arguments that are passed into 
the function are checked. Things that are checked include that 
low_bound < up_bound <= min(x,y) and that s < t}
}
\value{
vector: the simulated minimum, 'min', and time where minimum occurs, 'tau'
}
\description{
Simulation of a minimum point of a Brownian bridge
}
\examples{
# simulate a minimum between 0 and 1 of a Brownian bridge starting 
# at 0 and ending at 0 in time [0,1]
min_sampler(x = 0, y = 0, s = 0, t = 1, low_bound = -1, up_bound = 0)

# plotting multiple simulated minimums and their times
minimums <- sapply(1:5000, function(i) {
  min_sampler(x = 0, y = 0, s = 0, t = 1, low_bound = -10, up_bound = 0)
})
plot(x = minimums[2,], y = minimums[1,], pch = 20, lwd = 0.1,
     xlab = 'Time', ylab = 'X')
