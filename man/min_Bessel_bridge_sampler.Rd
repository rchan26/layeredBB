\title{Bessel Bridge point sampler given minimum (Algorithm 15 in ST329)}
\usage{
min_Bessel_bridge_sampler(x, y, s, t, m, tau, q, checks = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{start value of Bessel bridge}

\item{y}{end value of Bessel bridge}

\item{s}{start time of Bessel bridge}

\item{t}{end time of Bessel bridge}

\item{m}{minimum point}

\item{tau}{time of minimum point}

\item{q}{time of simulation}

\item{checks}{logical value to determine if arguments that are passed into 
the function are checked. Things that are checked include that
s < t, that q is in [s,t], that tau is in [s,t], that m <= min(x,y) 
and that if tau == s or tau == t, then m == x or m == y, respectively}
}
\value{
simulated point of the Bessel bridge at time q
}
\description{
Simulation of a point of a Bessel bridge at time q, given minimum occurs at time tau
}
\examples{
# simulating a point at q=0.2 for a Bessel bridge starting at 0 and ending 
# at 0 in time [0,1] given minimum is at -0.4 at time 0.6
